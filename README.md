# Customer-Churn-Prediction-of-Bank

The aim of this project is to predict whether the customer will churn or not from the bank using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Workflow
-Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training with classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier)
- Model evaluation

## üîç Dataset
- Source: Kaggle_Bank Churn Dataset
- Features: Credit score, age, balance, etc.
- Target: Churn (0 or 1)

##  Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
